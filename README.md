# Solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Quantum Annealing

## Overview
This project compares quantum annealing and brute force methods in solving the Knapsack Problem. It focuses on demonstrating the efficiency and practicality of quantum computing in optimization.

## Objectives
- Compare quantum annealing with traditional brute force approaches.
- Analyze efficiency in different problem scales.

## Methodology
Using scenarios with varying item counts, the project contrasts the effectiveness and processing time of both methods, with a focus on quantum annealing.

## Key Findings
- Quantum annealing outperforms brute force in larger, more complex scenarios.
- Quantum results show close approximations, but not exact solutions compared to brute force.

## Conclusion
This study highlights quantum annealing as a more efficient, albeit less precise, solution for complex optimization problems like the Knapsack Problem.
